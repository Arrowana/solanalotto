## Value proposition
“A fool and his money are soon parted” this time at least fairly and transparently.

26% of the world population gambles.

The global gambling industry is valued at about $635 billion, all of that to draw random numbers (sometimes) and provide fancy frontends (casinos, betting websites…) [source](https://www.casino.org/features/gambling-statistics/).

Application:
- Replace big lotteries
- Organization fundraiser digitized, low cost and transparent. Think about the school fundraiser lotteries.
